# eda20-live-code

This respository stores student version coding scripts for the EDA live coding lectures. It will periodically contain any additional lecture materials you might need for class.

Students should clone this respository to their machine and then 'pull' each week for more coding lecture material. Your .Rmd file will not be completely filled out, you must fill out by watching the video on Brightspace.
